-- Audio (or generally /sound/, it is not in principle limited to the human hearing
-- range) is actually just a single physical quantity (in reality pressure)
-- that varies in time, i.e. a function \"@p :: Time -> Pressure@\".
-- This is very naturally expressed by the 'Timeline'
-- approach. The time-chunks are, as usual in DSP, themselves containers
-- for discretely time-sampled values of /p/; the sampling rate (and /kind of sampling/,
-- for that matter) is a chunk-generation parameter, i.e. the evaluator of
-- the audio data can request what sample rate (and thus, in a rather rough sense,
-- /quality/) of audio they need.

-- | \"Silent audio\" is handled as a special case: it consists exclusively of

-- | While it is often sufficient to use one sample rate throughout the processing
-- of an entire project, there may be occasions where it becomes necessary to
-- convert. Most obviously, audio files are not adaptive, but also different
-- audio effects tend to need different amounts of \"frequency headroom\"
-- to work well, for instance distortion effects may produce audible aliasing unless
-- used with sufficient headroom.
